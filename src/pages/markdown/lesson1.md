# Lesson 1: JavaScript and Node

Throughout this guide, we will be working in JavaScript. Why JavaScript? Because it is used everywhere! Javascript is used in modern web frameworks like React (created and used by Meta/Facebook) and Vue (used by Netflix and others), it is used to script tests in frameworks like Cypress and Postman, it can even be used to create art and visuals using libraries like three.js and p5.js. In fact, according to PluralSight, it is the number one most learned technology on their platform.

Another great reason to learn JavaScript is that it is a comparatively beginner-friendly language: it is reasonably easy to read, has a forgiving syntax, and a lot of the more complex functionality is abstracted into nice, easy to use methods.

While JavaScript may look pretty “computerish”, it is in fact much closer to English than anything that a computer can understand. So, we need compilers and translators to facilitate running of our code. Node.js is the runtime most used to achieve this in JavaScript. You can install Node to your device and try writing and running some JavaScript locally, but for the purpose of this guide we recommend using a sandbox like [Replit](replit.com). Replit is a free, in-browser development platform where you can quickly spin up a Node environment and start coding. Sandboxes like replit are great, because they are safe environments where you cannot do any damage. If the code freezes up, you can always just close the tab and open a new one.

The other advantage is that you will not have to use the command line to install and run software like you would if you were learning on your computer. The command line (usually command prompt on Windows, terminal on MacOS) is a way of controlling your computer using text commands. It is incredibly useful, and we will touch on it in a later chapter but for now save yourself the hassle and use a sandbox.

The best way to learn to code is by doing, so for best results you will want to put this site side-by-side with a blank Node repl and follow along with the lessons. If you find that you’re curious about something, follow that curiosity! Change the code, break it and see if you can fix it again. That is a great way to develop your understanding.
