Now that you’re eating code challenges for breakfast, you’ll (hopefully) be getting interviews. Every company runs the interview process differently, but in general you can expect:

*	A conversion with two interviewers lasting around thirty minutes to an hour (sometimes longer if you are asked to complete a code challenge during the interview)

*	A portion of the interview where you discuss yourself and your background. You’re likely to be asked some generic “competency” questions. These generally relate to things like the role you take in teams, how you learn best, what projects you have worked on etc. At a junior level you can expect this section to take up the bulk of the interview.

*	A portion of the interview where you answer some technical questions. These are intended to gauge your understanding, but also how well you can explain complex concepts. At a junior level these are usually relatively simple, so don’t worry too much!

*	Some companies may ask you to complete a coding challenge during the interview. If this is the case, they will usually give you some time to complete the task alone.

*	If you completed a coding challenge before the interview, you may be asked to do a walkthrough of the code. Take it line by line, and clearly explain what each line does.


#### Some tips for a successful interview:

*	Don’t worry about being too formal. Tech is generally a fairly casual industry, so just be yourself and be friendly. Remember that we want to work with people that we like!

*	Do your homework on the company and the role. Understand what the company does, and what you would be doing there. Make some notes that you can refer to about some of the company’s clients, the tech that they use, where their office is, who their CEO is. Being able to bring any of these up shows that you are genuinely interested.

*	Have some answers in your pocket. Competency and tech questions don’t change too much from company to company, so look up some lists of interview questions online and have a few prepped answers ready to go with examples from your life/career.

*	Ask questions. Come to the interview prepared with 5 or so relevant questions (but not “how much does it pay?”) and take notes during the interview so that you can ask some based on your conversation.

*	Honesty is important. If you don’t know something, that’s fine! At a junior level, most employers will provide training, and showing a willingness to learn is more important than knowing a tech already. On the other hand, if an interviewer gets the feeling that they are being lied to, there’s no way that you’ll be getting the job!

*	Being humble !== putting yourself down. You can be honest about shortcomings without being negative. For example, instead of saying “I’m bad at Java”, say “Java is something that I would like to get better at”.

*	Present yourself well. There’s no need to wear anything too formal but try not to look like you just rolled out of bed (even if you just did). If you’re interviewing remotely, check how your room looks on webcam. If it’s anything short of an Architectural Digest cover, just stick a background filter on.  


Interviews are stressful, nobody likes them. Here are some tips that may help you relax.

*	Prepare as best you can. This sounds obvious but being prepared will genuinely help you relax. If the company has not told you what to expect on the day, you can always ask!

*	Make sure that you have lots of water. Try and have a jug as well as a glass. Water will keep your voice clear, and you can always take a sip if you need to buy a moment before answering a question.

*	Remember that interviewers are just people! We want you to do well in the interview, so try not to feel like it is a combative situation.
